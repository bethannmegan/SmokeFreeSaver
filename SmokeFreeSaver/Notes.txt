Create properties in viewmodel:
- Counter (counting the days smoke free) (int)
- Price of pack of cigarettes/vape (double/decimal)
- Total money saved (double/decimal)
- How many packs per week (int)

Smoke-Free Logic (class library) will have methods to calculate
Another project (data access) - Repository - will store results

Stored in database:
- ID (int)
- Total Saved (decimal/double)
- Total Days without Smoking (decimal/double)

2 methods:
